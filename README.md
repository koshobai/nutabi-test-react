Hello all,

I'm writing up a website for my employer. Fingers crossed it's good!

//just a heads up: anytime I make a new project, I use the same title for the web app that I deploy to Firebase

//feel free to type the project title as is + .web.app into your address bar to access the current build (fear not; it's always protected with https)
